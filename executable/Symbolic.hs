{- 
all subsequences of t should be considered for the position of one reading

symbolic must have at least one word with >1 reading, because of the requirement that applying R must make a difference

First rule: we must find some input so that it applies, no other requirements.
Second rule: we must find some input so that it applies, and first rule doesn't apply.

-----

First task: find such input that a rule will have effect, or prove there is none
1) Target    of the rule must be in the analysis
2) Condition of the rule must be in the context

     is it enough that all readings in the symbolic sentence have just one tag?

     Number of readings is potentially |subsequences tags| (???), but can be smaller.
