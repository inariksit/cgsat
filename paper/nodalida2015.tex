We implement Constraint Grammar using a SAT solver.

We experiment with different strategies to maximise the number of instances to apply rules;
this will also lead to different orderings of the rules and ways of solving conflicts.

\section{Introduction}
Constraint Grammar (CG) was first introduced by \cite{KarlssonTODO}. 
It is a tool for disambiguating output by morphological analyser.


\section{Related work}
\label{sect:related}

Application of logic to POS tagging or shallow parsing isn't new;
\cite{lager1998, lager2000} present constraint rules as 
a disjunctive logic program.

Our implementation is inspired by this approach,
but unlike Lager's our implementation tries to emulate the CG
formalism in behaviour and features offered.
% What we do better: implement something that takes existing CG rules and applies them to text, trying to mimic/outperform current CG implementations.

Transformation-Based Learning of Rules for CG tagging (the paper with rules where ordering didn't matter so much)



\section{Implementation using SAT solver}
\label{sect:pdf}

SAT solving is based on a technique called unit propagation:
a set of complex Boolean clauses is simplified, starting from unit
clauses, which consist of just a single variable, and working up to a
solution, where all variables in the set have a True or False value.

SAT solving is used for many applications where constraints must be
satisfied, such as software and hardware verification.

Let us demonstrate the approach with the example sentence 
\emph{the bear sleeps}. After applying morphological tagger, we get the following analyses:

\begin{verbatim}
"<the>"
        "the" det
"<bear>"
        "bear" n sg
        "bear" v pl
"<sleeps>"
        "sleep" n pl
        "sleep" v sg p3
\end{verbatim}

We make each analysis a variable \texttt{v1}--\texttt{v5}. 
For instance, \texttt{v3} is a hypothesis that the correct analysis 
for the word form ``bear'' is \texttt{"bear" n pl}.
Before applying rules, we must make sure that in each position
at least one of the analyses is true. We add our first disjunctions:

\begin{itemize}
\item [] $v1$ \\ $v2 \vee v3$ \\ $v4 \vee v5$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rule ordering}
\label{ssec:ordering}

Ordering and conflicts : the most important differences here

\cite{koskenniemi92}
\begin{quote}Rules in the CG formalism are typically [--] executed as successive groups.
In finite-state syntax, rules are logically unordered.\end{quote}

% VISLCG ad hoc ordering:
% 1. SELECT before REMOVE.
% 2. SELECT rules targetting more preferred tags before 
%   rules targetting less preferred targets.
% 3. REMOVE rules targetting less preferred tags before
 %   rules targetting more preferred targets.
% 4. By order of appearance in rule file.

In CG3, the rules are applied in the order of appearance in the rule file.

A typical CG rule sequence starts with stronger rules
