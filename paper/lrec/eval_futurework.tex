\section{Evaluation and Future Work}

We tested three grammars for rules that cannot apply. The smallest grammar was Dutch, with 68 rules; second was Spanish with 279 rules, and the largest was Finnish, with 1185 rules.
For the smaller grammars, we were able to verify manually that the results hold.

\# rules in grammar   & 68              & 279               & 1185              \\ \hline
\# redundant rules found & 1               & \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

% * Preliminary results
%  - dutch & spanish
%  - mention scalability
%  - talk about size of SAT problem -- give number of SAT clauses for the last rule in the biggest grammar I have

% * Future work
%  - analysing different grammar formalisms
%  - asking different questions
%  - restrict yourself to readings that are actually words
