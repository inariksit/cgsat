\section{Evaluation and Future Work}
\label{sec:eval}

We tested three grammars to find rules that cannot apply. The smallest grammar was Dutch, with 68 rules; second was Spanish with 279 rules, and the largest was Finnish, with 1185 rules.
For the smaller grammars, we were able to verify manually that the results are true.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}

                      & \textsc{nld}  & \textsc{spa}  & \textsc{fin}  \\ \hline
Rules in grammar      & 68              & 279               & 1185              \\ \hline
Redundant rules found & 1               & ???               & ???    \\ \hline
Running time          & 7s              & 3min 22s          & 3h 26min    \\ \hline

% Instead of whole grammar, look at specific rules, test with different number of rules before

\todo{Analyse the results. I didn't even touch the Finnish results yet. Maybe mention other things we found from the grammar, like the nonsensical set definition from Spanish grammar (confused and and or, requiring a word to be noun AND verb AND conj AND preposition ...). }

Currently, the speed is not great. The Finnish grammar approaches a realistic size of grammars.
The size of the SAT problem was \todo{some real numbers and analysis here \& promises that it can be fixed}.

For future work, we want to improve the performance and scale up to larger grammars, and handle the full expressivity of CG-3, with \textsc{map}, \textsc{add} and \textsc{substitute} rules.
We want to also ask different questions, such as \todo{...}.
We can be smarter about SAT things.

Compare with a corpus-based test: do we find the same problems?

Finally, we want to test the approach to other grammar formalisms.



% * Preliminary results
%  - dutch & spanish
%  - mention scalability
%  - talk about size of SAT problem -- give number of SAT clauses for the last rule in the biggest grammar I have

% * Future work
%  - analysing different grammar formalisms
%  - asking different questions
%  - restrict yourself to readings that are actually words
