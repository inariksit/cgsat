Constraint Grammar (CG, \cite{karlsson1995constraint})
% \citep[CG][]{karlsson1995constraint} 
is a formalism for disambiguating morphologically analysed input.
CGs are valuable language resources for rule-based language processing, especially for lesser resourced languages. They are robust and require no extensive corpora or other language resources. The formalism is lightweight, and even small CGs are shown to be worthwile \cite{lene_trond2011}.

As CGs grow larger, .

\cite{bick2013tuning} presents efforts to optimise hand-written CGs using machine learning techniques.
While Bick's experiments show improvements in results, the grammar writer is none the wiser why is the grammar better.
Our toolset is designed to complement the existing efforts.
The ideal use case would be a grammar writer, who wants to know e.g.

\begin{itemize}
\item Is there a sentence that triggers rule(s) X but not rule(s) Y
\item Give a sentence that is ambiguous but doesn't trigger any rules
\item Restrict tag combinations within one word
\end{itemize}

The technique requires an existing morphological lexicon, but no corpus.
This makes it suitable also for languages without large corpora.
Authors writing grammars for well-resourced languages can also benefit from the technique, as an additional tool along with a gold standard corpus. 
Hand-annotated corpora are commonly used in the development of CGs
 \cite{voutilainen99}, because they give immediate feedback whether a new rule
increases or decreases accuracy, and by how large margin.

% * Describe problem: CGs are huge & prone to mistakes,
%  * we are looking at conflicts such as ...
%  * if you forgot a case
%  * some evidence that big CGs have conflicts and this is a real problem
%  * Eckhard's paper to explain why conflicting rules are a problem
%  * Goal: help grammar writer while they are writing the grammar, to avoid these kinds of problems
%  * Examples

% * Describe the technique

% * Preliminary results
%  - dutch & spanish
%  - mention scalability
%  - talk about size of SAT problem -- give number of SAT clauses for the last rule in the biggest grammar I have

% * Future work
%  - analysing different grammar formalisms
%  - asking different questions
%  - restrict yourself to readings that are actually words
