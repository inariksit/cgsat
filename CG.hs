--for OR, we make a list of lists, all in sequence.
--for AND, we need to make them parallel and put in a form with OR as the first constructor
--ie. AND (OR C1 C2) (C3) ---> OR (AND C1 C3) (AND C2 C3)
--just one level of nesting, should make this work for all inputs ... then again who writes millions of nested ands and ors
--for NOT, rather make some rules to get a normal form? e.g.
-- * NOT (OR a b)  = NOT a && NOT b
-- * NOT (AND a b) = NOT a || NOT b
