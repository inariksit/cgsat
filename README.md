Implementing Constraint Grammar using SAT solver.

SAT 
  - Helper functions for using MiniSat

bnfc
  - BNFC grammar for parsing CG rules. Autogenerated files are there because I added "BNFC." in front of all of the so that they could be in a separate directory.

data
  - Hungarian CG rules and morpho analysed data to use as examples

executable
  - just to make things more complicated and add more directories

test
  - some QuickCheck tests (mostly because it's fun to random generate rules)
