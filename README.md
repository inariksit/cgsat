Implementing Constraint Grammar using SAT solver.

Installation: just type make.
It will first compile the BNFC files and then just do cabal configure && cabal build.

It's using https://github.com/koengit/satplus/ , not on hackage (?)

-----------------------

bnfc
  - BNFC grammars for parsing CG rules and Apertium input format.

data
  - Hungarian, Spanish and English CG rules and morpho analysed data to use as examples

executable
  - just to make things more complicated and add more directories

test
  - some QuickCheck tests (mostly because it's fun to random generate rules)
