Implementing Constraint Grammar using SAT solver.

SAT 
  -- Helper functions for using MiniSat

bnfc
  -- BNFC grammar for parsing CG rules. Autogenerated files are there because I added "BNFC." in front of all of the so that they could be in a separate directory.

data
  -- Hungarian CG rules and morpho analysed data to use as examples

test
  -- some QuickCheck tests. Probably stopped working when I changed stuff.
        

* cabal build fails, just type `ghc CG_SAT' and it works.
