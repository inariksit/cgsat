Implementing Constraint Grammar using SAT solver.

  - Helper functions for using MiniSat

  - BNFC grammar for parsing CG rules. Autogenerated files are there because I added "BNFC." in front of all of the so that they could be in a separate directory.

  - Hungarian CG rules and morpho analysed data to use as examples

test
  - some QuickCheck tests. Probably stopped working when I changed stuff.
